<p>My story has remained the same through the class.  I really enjoyed being in a band and everything that it came along with.</p>
<p>The touring, the fun, the music, and of coarse the fans kept me going on the road.  Part of me misses it everyday.</p>
<p>This time the story includes my equipment as well as one of the band names I was in. Enjoy!</p>
